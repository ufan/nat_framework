* /td/ package
** TDEngine
    *Three Trader Interface are used*.
*** CTP and EES are alternative to each other
**** EES has three versions
*** Xt is used alone
*** All three Trader Api has similar design

** Helper
   *Helper sources are not part of TDEngine program*.
   *They are part of Python extension exported symbols*.
   
   /Helper/s do the real job of send/delete order, get return message and init job.
   They are managed using *Factory* design pattern.
   There are 4 types of Helper:
   - CTDHelperFake :: useless
   - CTDHelperComm :: using /io/ as communication channel
   - CTDHelperPipe :: using pipe as communication channel
   - CTDHelperPython :: just an python engine, which can execute Python scripts. Replay the work to other /Helper/s

   /CStrategy/ and /CStrategyProcess/ are the driving engine to use /Helper/s to finish the jobs.
   They are interface facing the end user. And they are exported to Python module /libstrategy/.
   User just need to provide a json configuration file to choose a specific /Helper/ for use.
   /CStrategy/ and /CStrategyProcess/ will dispatch all jobs to the underlying /Helper/ to finish.
   
   Directory /strategy/demo/ provides a full example of the full chain.
   
   But, there is no example showing how to use /CTDHelperPython/.
