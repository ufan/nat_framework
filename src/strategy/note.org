* Strategy management
  Two methods available:
  1. Local method: the running strategy instance keeps its own private record in the heap.
     It runs as a standalone strategy. This is the default one.
  2. Central method: use a shared memory hash table to keep a record for each running
     strategy instances on the same host. *StgManager* can be used to manage this table.
     This is activated by setting 's_use_shm_controller'.
