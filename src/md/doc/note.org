** Helper
   Five types Helper provides:
   - CMDHelperComm ::
   - CMDHelperPipe ::
   - CMDHelperReplayIO ::
   - CMDHelperReplayCtpDump ::
   - CMDHelperPython :: 
** Engine type
*** Interface defined in *IMDEngine*
    *IMDEngine* in the abstract base class for all types of md engine.
    It defines the interface of md engine and the common implementation functions for all types of implementation.
    
**** Interface functions to be implemented in daughter class
     All the following virtual functions are pure abstract.
     This means no default behaviour defined, the developer is meant to provide his own implementation.
     
     - init() :: used in /initEngine()/
     - start() :: used in /runEngine()/
     - join() ::
     - release() ::
     - subscribe(const vector<string>) ::
     - unsubscribe(const vector<string>) ::
    
**** Common functions available to all daughter class
     The following functions are not virtual functions.
     They provide some common behaviour which are needed in all types of implementation.
     More importantly, they defines the engine's working procedure.
     The underlying behaviour of a specific type of engine is processed by invoking the pure abstract functions defined above.
     They are the user interface to end user.
     
     - initEngine(const json& j_conf) :: 
       Initialize the engine with following steps
       1) init() :: 
       2) createPath() ::
       3) md_writer_.setPageSize() :: if the "/MDEngine/PageSize" item exists in configuration
       4) init data member /self_id_/ from /name_/
       5) CSystemIO ::instance().inti()
       6) getBaseInfo() :: get information of td engine the name of which is provided by configuration file from "/TDEngine" item
        
     - runEngine() ::
       Run the engine loop, invoked after initEngine()
       1) start()
       2) engine_subscribe(config_["MDEngine/subscribe"])
       3) CSystemIO::instance().createReader()
       4) writeStartSignal()
       5) while loop, waiting for command
       6) release()
        
     - stop() :: Stop the engine
      
     - engine_subscribe(vector<string> &instr) :: 
     - engine_unsubscribe(vector<string> &instr) ::
     - querySubscribedInstrument() :: return the list of subscribed instruments
     - writeStartSignal() :: write START command to IOWriter
     - name() ::  return the name of this engine
     - getBaseInfo(string td_engine_name, int timeout) :: 
 
**** Data members
     - do_running_ /(volatile bool)/ ::
     - md_writer_ /(*CSafteRawIOWriter*)/ ::
     - self_id_ /(int)/ ::
     - day_night_mode_ /(uint8_t)/ :: Working mode of this engine. 
       It's initialized in the initializor based on current time of the day when the engine is created.
       It's day mode if engine is created from 6:00 ~ 18:00, otherwise it's night mode.
     - name_ /(string)/ :: 
     - subs_instr_ /(map<string,int>)/ :: a list of subscribed instruments
     - config_ /(json)/ :: *JSON* configuration information provide by end user
       
*** /ctp/ from *CMDEngineCtp*
*** /ees/ from *CMDEngineEES*
*** /onload_ees/ from *CMDEngineEESOnload*

** Configuration
   - MDEngine :: main entry point
     - type :: engine backend, available option "ctp", "ees", "onload_ees"
     - log4cplus :: logger service configuration file
   - CTPMD :: configuration for the engine based on *CTP*
     - name :: name of the engine, it's used in *CMDEngineCtp::init()*
     - con_dir :: the path needed by *CThostFtdcMdApi*, for flow file
     - front :: used in *CMDEngineCtp::init()*
     - timeout :: connection timeout 
     - subscribe :: list of subscribed instruments
   - TDEngine :: get the td engine base information
     - engine_name :: name of the td engine
     - timeout :: timeout of the request of the base information
