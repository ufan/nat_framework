* Logger
The logger library is /log4cplus/.
Integration of /log4cplus/ is managed by *CMake* as a external project.
/log4cplus/ is modeled after /log4j/, so the documentation of /log4cplus/ is the same as /log4j/.
[[http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/manual.html][Website of /log4j/]].

** Usage
The usage of /log4cplus/ in /NatFramework/ is:
1. Only *root* logger is used, no logger hierarchy below *root* logger
2. A configuration file is used to configure /log4cplus/. The path of the this configuration file is setup in *JSON* configuration file by the key "log4cplus".
3. If "log4cplus" is set, but the logger configuration file does not exist, the output of logger is streamed to console screen by default.
4. If "log4cplus" does not exist, the program will fail without error message.
