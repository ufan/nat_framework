* Getting the source
  The third party libraries (such as, EES, CTP ...) are integrated into the source base
  as git submodule.

  The command to clone the whole source base including ThirdParty libraries is:
  /git clone --recurse-submodules -b <branch_name> <repo_address>/
  
* CMake
  The preferred build system is *CMake* by /cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PPREFIX=<XXX> -DBoost_ROOT=<XXX>/. 
** Pre-requsites
*** install python2.7
*** install and build boost_python agains python2.7
*** install CMake latest (>=3.15)
*** autotools is needed to build libev
** Dependencies
*** External (i.e. source available)
**** log4cplus
**** libev
*** ThirdParty (i.e. only binary library available)
**** CTP
**** EES
**** Xt
     
* /make/ based build system
** copy ThirdParty under src/ directory
** edit /src/make/head.mk/, change *boost_DIR* and *PYTHON_BIN* accordingly
** invoke /make/ command
*** a new /release/ directory will be created with all targets inside
* Caveants
** change libev.so.4.0.0 to libev.so
*** only dynamic linkage success right now, to be investigated later
